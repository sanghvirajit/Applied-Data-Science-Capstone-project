# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-project

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

In this project, it was predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully or not using machine learning techniques.

# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This Capstone project was the integral part of the IBM Data science professional certificate. 

In this Professional Certificate, developed and honed handson skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. Starting with an orientation of Data Science and its Methodology, became familiar and used a variety of data science tools, learned Python and SQL, performed Data Visualization and Analysis, and created Machine Learning models. 

In the process, completed several labs and assignments on the IBM cloud service including this main Capstone Project, which included all the task from the previous 9 courses, at the end to apply and demonstrate knowledge and skills.
